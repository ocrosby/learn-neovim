## Getting Help

### Before Asking

1. **Check `:help`** - Neovim's built-in help is comprehensive
2. **Search existing questions** - Your question may already be answered
3. **Read error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Try `:checkhealth`** - Diagnose common issues

### How to Ask Good Questions

1. **Include your config** - Share relevant configuration snippets
2. **Describe the problem** - What you expected vs what happened
3. **Include Neovim version** - Run `nvim --version`
4. **Show error messages** - Copy exact error text
5. **Minimal reproducible example** - Isolate the problem

### Where to Ask What

| "Which plugin for...?" | r/neovim, Discourse |
| "Quick config question" | Discord, Matrix |
| "Feature request" | GitHub Issues, Discourse |
| "Plugin development" | Discourse, GitHub Discussions |

## Code of Conduct

Most Neovim communities follow these principles:

- **Be respectful** - Everyone was a beginner once
- **Search first** - Before asking, check if it's been answered
- **Give back** - Help others when you can
- **Stay on topic** - Keep discussions relevant
- **No elitism** - Neovim vs other editors debates aren't productive

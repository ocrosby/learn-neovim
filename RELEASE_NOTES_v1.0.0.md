# Learn Neovim v1.0.0 - Complete Educational Resource

> A comprehensive, step-by-step guide to mastering Neovim from beginner to advanced

I'm excited to announce the first public release of **Learn Neovim** - a complete educational resource for learning Neovim from absolute beginner to advanced user.

## 🎯 What Is This?

Unlike Neovim distributions (LazyVim, NvChad, AstroNvim), this is a **structured learning path** that teaches you to build and understand your own Neovim configuration. Think of it as a comprehensive course rather than a pre-built setup.

## ✨ What's Included

### 📚 8 Progressive Learning Modules (15-25 hours)

1. **Introduction** - Why Neovim, installation, setup (30 min)
2. **Basics** - Modes, navigation, editing fundamentals (2-3 hrs)
3. **Intermediate** - Text objects, operators, macros (2-3 hrs)
4. **Configuration** - Building init.lua from scratch (1-2 hrs)
5. **Plugin Management** - lazy.nvim and essential plugins (2-3 hrs)
6. **LSP** - Language servers and IDE features (2-4 hrs)
7. **Advanced** - Lua scripting and automation (3-5 hrs)
8. **Workflows** - Git, debugging, testing (3-4 hrs)

### 💻 4 Production-Ready Example Configs

- **Minimal** (31 lines, 0 plugins) - Perfect for learning fundamentals
- **Basic** (~300 lines, 14 plugins) - General-purpose development
- **Python Dev** (~350 lines, 17 plugins) - pytest, debugging, virtual env
- **Web Dev** (~340 lines, 18 plugins) - JS/TS/React with ESLint, Tailwind

All configs are fully documented with every line explained!

### 📖 Comprehensive Resources

- **4 Cheatsheets**: Basics, LSP, Lua, Plugins
- **50+ Exercises**: Hands-on practice in each module
- **100+ Code Examples**: Real-world scenarios
- **Curated Resources**: Articles, videos, communities

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

- **Progressive**: Start simple, build gradually
- **Understanding over copying**: Learn *why*, not just *what*
- **Hands-on**: Practice with exercises and examples
- **Build your own**: Create your perfect config from scratch
- **Modern**: Lua, lazy.nvim, LSP (Neovim 0.9+)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Try an example config without installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ocrosby/learn-neovim.git
cd learn-neovim
nvim -u examples/basic/init.lua
```

Or start the learning path:

```bash
# Start with Module 0
open docs/00-introduction/README.md
```

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- ✅ Complete beginners (never used Vim/Neovim)
- ✅ Vim users migrating to Neovim
- ✅ IDE users (VSCode, JetBrains) wanting to try Neovim
- ✅ Anyone who wants to truly understand their editor

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

### vs. Distributions (LazyVim, NvChad)
- **Learn Neovim**: Teaches you to build your own
- **Distributions**: Give you a pre-built setup

### vs. Other Tutorials
- **Learn Neovim**: Complete, structured, 8-module progression
- **Others**: Often fragmented or outdated

### vs. kickstart.nvim
- **Learn Neovim**: Full course with exercises and explanations
- **kickstart**: Great starting template (less educational focus)

## 📊 By The Numbers

- **41+ Documentation Files**
- **29 Lesson Files**
- **4 Example Configs** (tested and validated)
- **4 Cheatsheets**
- **20+ Plugins Covered**
- **~20,000 Lines of Educational Content**

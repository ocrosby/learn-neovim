# Exercise 1: Mode Switching

Welcome to your first Neovim exercise! This file will help you practice switching between modes and understanding each mode's purpose.

INSTRUCTIONS: Work through each section. Read the task, perform it in Neovim, then move to the next. There are no "right answers" to submit - this is pure practice.

==============================================================================
PART 1: UNDERSTANDING NORMAL MODE
==============================================================================

You start in Normal mode every time you open Neovim. Normal mode is for:
- Navigation
- Executing commands
- Deleting, copying, pasting

Task 1.1: You're already in Normal mode. Press 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' to move around.
Task 1.2: Move to the word "practice" below and press 'x' to delete a character.

Task 1.3: Press 'u' to undo that deletion.

CHECKPOINT: You should still be in Normal mode. No mode indicator at the bottom.

==============================================================================

Task 2.1: Move your cursor to the START of the line below (use 0).
Task 2.2: Press 'i' to enter Insert mode BEFORE the cursor.

PART 3: INSERT MODE - AFTER CURSOR
==============================================================================

Task 3.1: Move to the END of the word "Hello" below (use 'e' or '$').
Task 3.2: Press 'a' to enter Insert mode AFTER the cursor.
Task 3.3: Type a space and "World", then press Esc.

Hello

Expected result: Hello World

==============================================================================
PART 4: INSERT MODE - NEW LINES
==============================================================================

Task 4.1: Position your cursor on the line "Line 1" below.
Task 4.2: Press 'o' to open a new line BELOW and enter Insert mode.
Task 4.3: Type "Line 2", press Esc.
Task 4.4: Press 'O' (capital) to open a new line ABOVE.

Task 7.3: Press ':' again.
Task 7.4: Type 'set number' and press Enter to show line numbers.

CHECKPOINT: You should see line numbers on the left.

==============================================================================
PART 8: MODE SWITCHING SPEED DRILL
==============================================================================

Practice switching modes quickly. Do this sequence 5 times:

1. Normal mode → Press 'i' → Insert mode
2. Type "test" → Press Esc → Normal mode
3. Press 'V' → Visual Line mode → Press Esc → Normal mode
4. Press ':' → Command mode → Press Esc → Normal mode

Practice here:



==============================================================================
PART 9: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
==============================================================================

Mistake 1: TYPING COMMANDS IN INSERT MODE
Task: Make sure you're in Normal mode before trying navigation commands.
Try: Press Esc (just to be sure), then press 'h' to move left.

Mistake 2: FORGETTING WHICH MODE YOU'RE IN
Task: Look at the bottom of your screen. What mode are you in?
Tip: If you see nothing, you're in Normal mode.
Tip: If you see "-- INSERT --", press Esc.

Mistake 3: USING ARROW KEYS
Task: Navigate this entire file using only h, j, k, l (no arrow keys!)

==============================================================================
PART 10: MODE MASTERY CHALLENGE
==============================================================================

Complete this sequence WITHOUT looking at the instructions:

1. Go to Normal mode
2. Move to the line "EDIT ME" below
3. Enter Insert mode at the END of the line (hint: 'a' or 'A')
4. Type " - COMPLETED"
5. Return to Normal mode
6. Save the file

EDIT ME

==============================================================================
COMPLETION CHECKLIST
==============================================================================

You've mastered modes when you can:
[ ] Switch to Insert mode without thinking (i, a, o, O)
[ ] Return to Normal mode instantly (Esc)
[ ] Enter Visual mode for selection (v, V)
[ ] Use Command mode for save/commands (:w, :q)
[ ] Know which mode you're in at all times
[ ] Navigate without arrow keys (h, j, k, l)

==============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
==============================================================================

1. Practice with real files (not just exercises)
2. Try to stay in Normal mode as your default
3. Move to Exercise 2: Navigation
4. Review: docs/01-basics/modes.md

Remember: Discomfort is temporary, efficiency is permanent!

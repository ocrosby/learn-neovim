## 🎯 What is Neovim?

Neovim is a modern text editor that makes you incredibly efficient once you learn it. 

**The big difference:** Instead of always typing text, you have different "modes":
- **Normal mode** - Navigate and edit (your default)
- **Insert mode** - Type text (like a normal editor)
- **Visual mode** - Select text
- **Command mode** - Run commands

This might feel weird at first, but it's what makes Neovim so fast.

### Why Try It?

**Speed** - Navigate and edit without reaching for your mouse or arrow keys.

**Everywhere** - Available on every system. Great for remote servers.

**Customizable** - Build the exact editor you want.

**Future-proof** - Skills you learn today will work for decades.

**Modern** - Unlike old Vim, Neovim has built-in support for IDE features.

### The Secret Sauce: Composability

Instead of memorizing hundreds of shortcuts, you learn a "language":

- `d` = delete
- `i` = inside
- `w` = word

Combine them: `diw` = **d**elete **i**nside **w**ord

Once you know the language, you can create any command you need!

## Ready to Install?

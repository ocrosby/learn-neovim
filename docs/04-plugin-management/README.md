# Module 4: Plugin Management

Learn how to extend Neovim with plugins using lazy.nvim, the modern plugin manager.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand plugin managers and why lazy.nvim
- Install and configure lazy.nvim
- Add essential plugins
- Understand plugin configuration structure
- Manage plugin updates and lazy loading

## Estimated Time

2-3 hours

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Module 3: Configuration](../03-configuration/README.md)
- Comfortable with Lua basics
- Have a working `init.lua`

## Lessons

1. **[Introduction to Lazy.nvim](lazy-nvim.md)**
2. **[Essential Plugins](essential-plugins.md)**

## Why Plugins?

Plugins add functionality that Neovim doesn't have built-in: file trees, fuzzy finding, Git integration, themes, and more.

**Philosophy**: Add plugins only when you understand what problem they solve.

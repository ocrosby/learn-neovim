## Reddit - r/neovim

**Title**: `[Resource] Learn Neovim - Complete Guide from Beginner to Advanced (v1.0.0)`

**Post**:

I've created a comprehensive learning resource for Neovim that takes you from absolute beginner to advanced user. Unlike distributions, this teaches you to build and understand your own config.

## What's Inside

**8 Progressive Modules** (15-25 hours total):
- Introduction, Basics, Intermediate
- Configuration (init.lua from scratch)
- Plugin Management (lazy.nvim)
- LSP setup and configuration
- Advanced Lua scripting
- Complete workflows (Git, debugging, testing)

**4 Example Configs** (all production-ready):
- **Minimal**: 31 lines, 0 plugins (learn fundamentals)
- **Basic**: ~300 lines, 14 plugins (general dev)
- **Python**: ~350 lines, 17 plugins (pytest, debugging, venv)
- **Web Dev**: ~340 lines, 18 plugins (JS/TS/React, ESLint, Tailwind)

Every line is explained!

**Plus**:
- 4 comprehensive cheatsheets
- 50+ hands-on exercises
- 100+ code examples
- Curated resources (articles, videos, communities)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ocrosby/learn-neovim.git
cd learn-neovim
nvim -u examples/basic/init.lua  # Try immediately
```

## Philosophy

- **Progressive learning**: No overwhelming config dumps
- **Understanding over copying**: Learn *why*, not just *what*
- **Build your own**: Create your perfect setup
- **Modern**: Lua, lazy.nvim, LSP (Neovim 0.9+)

## Who Is This For?

- Complete beginners (never used Vim)
- Vim users migrating to Neovim
- VSCode/JetBrains users curious about Neovim
- Anyone who wants to understand their editor

## Hacker News

**Title**: `Learn Neovim – Complete guide from beginner to advanced`

**URL**: `https://github.com/ocrosby/learn-neovim`

**Comment** (if posting as "Show HN"):

I built this resource after seeing many beginners struggle with Neovim. Distributions like LazyVim are great, but they don't teach you *why* things work.

This is a complete learning path with 8 modules, 4 example configs (from 31 lines to 350 lines), and hands-on exercises. Every configuration line is explained.

The goal: help you build your own perfect Neovim setup with full understanding.

Took several months to put together. Would love feedback from the community!

### Tweet 3 (Philosophy)

```
Why another Neovim resource?

Distributions (LazyVim, NvChad) give you a setup
Tutorials teach scattered concepts

Learn Neovim is different:
✅ Complete structured path
✅ Progressive learning
✅ Build from scratch
✅ Understand every line

For learners, not just users

## Dev.to Article

**Title**: `Learn Neovim: A Complete Guide from Beginner to Advanced`

**Tags**: `#neovim #vim #tutorial #beginners`

**Article Intro**:

```markdown
I've been using Neovim for years, and I've noticed a common pattern: beginners either copy configs they don't understand, or they bounce off Vim's learning curve entirely.

I created **Learn Neovim** to fix this. It's a complete, structured learning path that takes you from absolute beginner to building your own advanced Neovim configuration.

## What Makes It Different?

Unlike distributions (LazyVim, NvChad, AstroNvim) that give you a pre-built setup, Learn Neovim teaches you to build your own from scratch—with full understanding of every line.

## What's Inside?

## Background

After helping many beginners in various communities, I noticed they often:

Learn Neovim addresses all of these by providing a structured, progressive learning path.

4. Configuration (init.lua from scratch)
5. Plugin Management (lazy.nvim)
6. LSP Setup & Configuration
7. Advanced (Lua scripting)
8. Workflows (Git, debugging, testing)

**4 Example Configurations**:
- Minimal (learning focused)
- Basic (general purpose)
- Python Development
- Web Development

All configs are production-ready and fully documented.

**Resources**:
- 4 comprehensive cheatsheets
- 50+ exercises
- Curated articles, videos, communities

## Philosophy

- **Progressive**: Start simple, build gradually
- **Understanding**: Learn why, not just what
- **Hands-on**: Exercises in every module
- **Modern**: Lua, lazy.nvim, LSP
